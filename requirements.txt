# SMART Debt Tracker - Dependencies and Requirements

## Browser Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript ES6+ support
- Minimum browser versions:
  - Chrome 88+
  - Firefox 85+
  - Safari 14+
  - Edge 88+

## CDN Dependencies (Automatically loaded)
React@18.2.0                    # Core React library
ReactDOM@18.2.0                 # React DOM rendering
Babel Standalone@7.23.0         # JSX transpilation
Recharts@2.8.0                  # Chart visualization library
Tailwind CSS@3.3.0             # Utility-first CSS framework

## Local Development Server (Choose one)
# Python (built-in)
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (requires Node.js installation)
npx http-server

# VS Code Live Server Extension
# Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code

## Optional Development Tools
- Git (for version control)
- VS Code or any modern code editor
- Browser developer tools for debugging

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- Storage: 10MB for project files
- Internet connection: Required for initial CDN loading

## Security Considerations
- All data stored locally in browser localStorage
- No external API calls or data transmission
- HTTPS recommended for production deployment
- Regular browser cache clearing recommended

## Performance Notes
- Optimized for datasets up to 100 debts/goals
- Chart rendering requires 2GB+ RAM for large datasets
- localStorage limit: ~5-10MB per domain (varies by browser)

## Installation Notes
No package installation required - this is a client-side only application.
All dependencies are loaded via CDN from reliable sources:
- unpkg.com (React, Babel, Recharts)
- tailwindcss.com (Tailwind CSS)

## Compatibility Notes
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- LocalStorage must be enabled for data persistence
- Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- ES6+ features used (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
